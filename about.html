  <p>The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin?
  <br />My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery.
  <br />My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink.
  <br />He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy.
  <br />The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.
  <br />My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets.
  <br />When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds - pretty standard really.
  <br />At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.
  <br />There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking - I highly suggest you try it.
